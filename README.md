# MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification using various classifiers

## Dataset
Using a subset of the extremely popular simple data set MNIST. This data set has many images of handwritten digits 0 to 9. i.e., 10
classes. Each image is of size 28 Ã—28. In our subset there are 7000 images in total from 10 classes, out of which 6000
are for training and 1000 are for testing.

## Classification Methods

### Probabilistic methods of classification
- Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) 
- Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
- Bayesian Pairwise Majority Voting
- Simple perpendicular bisector based Majority Voting

### Nearest Neighbour based methods
- K nearest neighbour algorithm and performance analysis
- Reverse NN based outlier detection
